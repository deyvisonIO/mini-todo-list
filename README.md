This is a simple mini todo list project that I did to learn a little bit of nextjs. Every time you complete a task you earn 1 coin to a unlimited amount.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
